	<description>This mod adds a storyteller to the game. She is called Melody Mystical and she is a tiny bit crazy.
	
	Much like Randy, Melody doesn't follow any rules. She'll generate random events, and she won't care if they make a story of triumph or utter hopelessness. The difference being: Melody has a faster pace, more incidents and more cruel tendensies. If you thought Randy at least had a few rules, you will realize Melody does not, but she will give you a load of quests to keep you busy.
	
Suggestions and ideas are very welcome!
